Hello cuhzis and cuzhins. My name is Darius Barbano and I'm a freelance
developer based geographically in NYC. I'm also currently based and redpilled.
(Watch this Zuckerberg run git blame on that line ^^ and neither of us ever get
hired again)


# IMPORANT ONLY BASED SOFTWARE DEVES READ THIS

okay btw I meant to try and figure out why I couldn't run our backend and it
turns out that in v0.0.3 our backend just fails to authenticate but it's okay
because that was fixed in v0.0.4 of the autenticate.go file except no one
updated the dependencies so I just had to you know figure that one out myself
and instead of typing gitlab I actualyl typed github and found this gem.

In all seriousness I highly recommend github pages
you can peep mine [here](milesconn.io) I'm using vuepress. Kinda janky
but I like it. The thing I didn't like about jekyll is there wasn't a router so
I couldn't be a chad and route. ya feel.
